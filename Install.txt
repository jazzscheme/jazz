Dependencies
============

JazzScheme has very few dependencies

Gambit
------
You need to install Gambit binaries and also have Gambit's source code available
in a standard location so that JazzScheme can use (include "~/gambit/lib/header.scm") to
include Gambit internal stuff (see 16.1 Handling of file names in Gambit's documentation
for details on the ~ syntax)

Cairo
-----
If you plan on using the Jazz IDE or doing GUI development, Cairo needs to be installed.
Need to detail how and where to install Cairo...


Building
========

As a design goal, JazzScheme's code base is structured in such a way that it can be loaded
fully interpreted in the underlying Scheme. No external build is thus required. Just start
gsc in this directory and execute (j). Note that this relies on a Gambit feature to load any
gambcini.scm file located in the current directory.

For better performance you can build the jazz code using (bjazz) and build the jazz language
using (blang).
