- We have to think about and go through the code for what happens if we make for unix but no windowing
- Fix build on Cygwin / Windows that fails i think because Cygwin doesn't like just "jazz" just like unix
- Because of things like the text (for instance select all on a scrolled text), i do not see any other way
  than to restrict rectangles before the invalidate-rect to the platform. Do we also have to restrict so that
  if does not go further than the size of the window?
- When drawing selection in Text-View with the horizontal scroller moved we get a negative
  invalidate-rect
- When we load a file from the console and we are not in the good workspace, the screen does not get updated.
- Confirm that on mac x11 starts automatically on launching jedi


STEPHANE
- save-as is buggy and can save as x.gLevel
- F8 is broken because of a bug that crashes specific handling even in debug mode
- Fix the moniker-modal problem


GUILLAUME
- Eval of more than 1 definition
- Eval in user class
- Save confirmation happens twice when quitting application
- Add a section about irc on the jazz website
- High perf counters in Gambit should solve the problem of timings beeing so inconsistant in Windows
- Implement Windows copy / paste in the Gambit console
- Maybe more natural (cfg default: wd)
- open-string-pipe read-substring input-port-timeout-set!
- Need a clean solution to previously-focused-root management. One solution that looks clean would be to
  have the platform focus *always* to the overlapped and do the whole focus management ourselves with
  the Focus view. That way all the application activation events can be replaced in a platform independent
  maner by focus-gain/lose of the toplevel overlapped that can then set / reset the previously-focused-root
- Go through every walk method to verify that it does *not* forward-expr when not needed
- Termite
  - Not clear in documentation that there is a primordial process that is not the direct result
    of a spawn
  - node-init is not in the doc
  - Does termite implement message passing in a way that no tcp/ip is used for intra-node calls?
  - Look at Guillaume Germain's Dynamite web server!?
  - So is make-node to be used both for the actual node and for remotes and only the actual should call
    node-init ?
  - Everything i try crashes. There is no error validation? (node-init (current-node)) for instance
- (set! ##primordial-exception-handler-hook ##repl-exception-handler-hook)
