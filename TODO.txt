- test the new configuration on the mac!
- still have the damn problem of our changes not in the Gambit distrib
- now that i use the scheme reader i should do a s&r of #\EOF by eof-object and scrap #\EOF from the reader
- pour le mac separer le gui (windows + cairo) de jazz dans (lj) (ball) ...

- proper methods not as macros are also needed for knowing the return type of a call to a method
  - i want to do that before going further in annotations as i want first to decide if it is correct
    to only annotate the root method (annotations in a derived method should report an error)

- distribute jazz with a jazz.exe = gsc.exe in the architecture subdirs and put the gambit headers i use
  somewhere in the jazz source tree
