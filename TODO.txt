- Is ((x11 unix) at line 725 correct or just (unix) ?
- We have to think about and go through the code for what happens if we make for unix but no windowing
- Clean that i had to put
     (define cairo-include-path (path-expand "../../foreign/cairo/include"))
     (define cairo-lib-path     (path-expand "../../foreign/cairo/lib/windows"))
  at 3 diff places for windows
- Fix build on Cygwin / Windows that fails i think because Cygwin doesn't like just "jazz" just like unix
- Because of things like the text (for instance select all on a scrolled text), i do not see any other way
  than to restrict rectangles before the invalidate-rect to the platform. Do we also have to restrict so that
  if does not go further than the size of the window?

- bwinton@latte.ca interested in beta testing the web framework
- Fix slow text editing due to explorer not ending at current line
- double-click on wb manager
- edit guest and others in F8
- eval of more than 1 definition
- eval in user class
- save confirmation happens twice when quitting application
- ctr-shift arrow bugs
- in jazz.ui.image use a generic resource location
- if i eval recolorize-row it doesn't seem to work. this is due to (block) declaration
  the right behavior is to do (block) only in release safety
- F8 is broken
- Finish building to an arbitrary directory and bin release
- Need to set the jazz readtable for control-enter
- Add a section about irc on the jazz website
