- pour le mac separer le gui (windows + cairo) de jazz dans (lj) (ball) ...
- i moved the fonts dir inside the lib dir need to fix references

GUILLAUME
- still have the damn problem of our changes not in the Gambit distrib
- distribute jazz with a gsc.exe in the architecture subdirs!?
- why reimplement queues in Jazz???
- at what point i should start looking at the generated c code for my typical code
- ummm with a restriction type we could have a type like fxstring that is a string that guaranties that
  its length is bounded in the range of fixnums!
- because I want to do all type casting at call site for natives, I will need to always call the lowlevel
  ## version of the procedure
- ummm I think that saying car's signature is <pair:object> is wrong. Really, car's signature is <object:object>
  and throws an error if its parameter is not a pair. The <pair:object> is really a compile time specializer!
- s&r complet de dc par surface
- remettre Rect a fx et faire une autre classe pour les number ou l'inverse
- when axis are working, simplify the code and make sure it is well optimized for the case of rows with not alot
  of sons
- i should be able to clean *alot* of not directly related code that i was forced to put inside classes because i
  didn't have generics. A class that needs big time cleanup like this is Component
- specialize iterate and ??? on basic classes
- having a method with a name ending in a ~ crashes in release

- need to fix the save of text is buggy and loses the last line because of the new load-lines
- if i do a search in gambit's c files i will find a place that marc thought of for pasting and cutting from the
  system stack
