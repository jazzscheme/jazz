- Is ((x11 unix) at line 725 correct or just (unix) ?
- We have to think about and go through the code for what happens if we make for unix but no windowing
- Clean that i had to put
     (define cairo-include-path (path-expand "../../foreign/cairo/include"))
     (define cairo-lib-path     (path-expand "../../foreign/cairo/lib/windows"))
  at 3 diff places for windows
- Fix build on Cygwin / Windows that fails i think because Cygwin doesn't like just "jazz" just like unix
- Because of things like the text (for instance select all on a scrolled text), i do not see any other way
  than to restrict rectangles before the invalidate-rect to the platform. Do we also have to restrict so that
  if does not go further than the size of the window?

- save-as is buggy and can save as x.gLevel
- F8 is broken because of a bug that crashes specific handling even in debug mode

- bwinton@latte.ca interested in beta testing the web framework
- double-click on wb manager
- edit guest and others in F8
- eval of more than 1 definition
- eval in user class
- save confirmation happens twice when quitting application
- Add a section about irc on the jazz website
- Implement high perf counters in Gambit which should solve the problem of timings beeing so inconsistant
  in Windows
- Maybe more natural (cfg default: wd)
