GUILLAUME
- NEED to really think about the sharing of declarations when we do stuff like reload a file
- Find the problem with safety release
- Port the login dialog so that I can use a user for stable cataloging dev
- Test login with no jazz.dev dir and with something like ~/jazz/users
- Fix the drawing gradient in the logging screen
- After the next commit, try and do clean from scratch install of the binaries on both mac and windows
- Implement support for binary releases. A binary release should separate its binaries from the user
  compiled files so the user can easily cleanup his binaries without affecting the base. Also this enables
  us to have a patch to the problem of Git giving the current date to all newly installed files -> if .o1 compiled
  then compare with source and if not then always use the binaries .o1. Problem with this approack is that
  Jazz will not load changed files interpreted but it's not too bad as binary releases are for users. Developers
  of jazz will build from the source. Can we do better?
- Fix the cairo memory leaks

R4RS
- f1.0 notation
- internal defines
- quasiquote for vectors
- =>
- semantics of declarations that are bound only after beeing defined vs jazz which binds declarations
  accross the whole module. another incompatibility that is related is that scheme code can define the
  same variable multiple times -> a possible solution would be to implement scheme semantics for define
  and jazz semantics for definition which seems very consistant with both names
