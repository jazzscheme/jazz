JEREMIE
- Basic clipboard for Windows
- Check  window destroying in X11
- Investigate the segmentation fault when leaving Gambit in Mac OS with X11
- Check logic of X11 events. Especially the fact that the window element in events refer to the window attached to the event and not to the
   window receiving the event. This is especially bad when combined with (get-in-creation) because some window may get the handle of a des
   troyed window.
- Is there a dotted line mode in Cairo for the tree?

STEPHANE
- Multi-dispatch generics
- Look at SRFI-19 which does seems buggy with using sometimes 1000 and sometimes 10000
  for milli->nano. Also copy-time seems bugged.
- Expand bind to support type annotations
- Unify Scheme and Jazz sort
- Give Stephane a copy of Jazz classic

GUILLAUME
- Fix the events problems with non-toplevel windows
- Implement support for binary releases. A binary release should separate its binaries from the user
  compiled files so the user can easily cleanup his binaries without affecting the base. Also this enables
  us to have a patch to the problem of Git giving the current date to all newly installed files -> if .o1 compiled
  then compare with source and if not then always use the binaries .o1. Problem with this approack is that
  Jazz will not load changed files interpreted but it's not too bad as binary releases are for users. Developers
  of jazz will build from the source. Can we do better? Should have a dependencies file with refenrences to
  source files using SHA1
- Basic Jazz l&f
- When Stephane is done with generic methods, need to really think hard about wheter we should use generic methods
  instead of ~ syntax. As the cost of a generic method call is void when type info is available, using generic methods
  at large may not be too costly. Need to think how to preserve encapsulation in the context of generic methods
- Because language has some very critical functions like search, find, ... I think that when we have a typed dispatch
  with only 1 level of indirection that maybe specializing will not be as necessary for big functions like search
- Fix the cairo memory leaks. Add a deallocator to our structures and call foreign-nullify in the with special form.
  - This will probably unify with and with-closed
  - One thing that is very nice with foreign release functions (and wills!?) is that we do not need to wrap the
    expansion of with inside an unwind-protect (not 100% sure about this as sometimes, having the object closed in
    the dynamic scope is an important part of a function's semantics...)
- Understand and fix why the build scripts do not show output, only all at once if there is an error (ask Marc)

R4RS
- r4rstest.scm
- f1.0 notation
- internal defines
- quasiquote for vectors
- =>
- semantics of declarations that are bound only after beeing defined vs jazz which binds declarations
  accross the whole module. another incompatibility that is related is that scheme code can define the
  same variable multiple times -> a possible solution would be to implement scheme semantics for define
  and jazz semantics for definition which seems very consistant with both names
