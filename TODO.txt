GUILLAUME
- NEED to really think about the sharing of declarations when we do stuff like reload a file
- Find the problem with safety release
- Port the login dialog so that I can use a user for stable cataloging dev
- Test login with no jazz.dev dir and with something like ~/jazz/users
- Fix the drawing gradient in the logging screen
- Remove YY and ZZ when all is done

R4RS
- f1.0 notation
- internal defines
- quasiquote
- =>
- semantics of declarations that are bound only after beeing defined vs jazz which binds declarations
  accross the whole module. another incompatibility that is related is that scheme code can define the
  same variable multiple times -> a possible solution would be to implement scheme semantics for define
  and jazz semantics for definition which seems very consistant with both names
