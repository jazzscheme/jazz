JEREMIE
- Basic clipboard

STEPHANE
- Multi-dispatch generics
- Look at SRFI-19 which does seems buggy with using sometimes 1000 and sometimes 10000
  for milli->nano. Also copy-time seems bugged.

GUILLAUME
- Fix the events problems with non-toplevel windows
- Implement support for binary releases. A binary release should separate its binaries from the user
  compiled files so the user can easily cleanup his binaries without affecting the base. Also this enables
  us to have a patch to the problem of Git giving the current date to all newly installed files -> if .o1 compiled
  then compare with source and if not then always use the binaries .o1. Problem with this approack is that
  Jazz will not load changed files interpreted but it's not too bad as binary releases are for users. Developers
  of jazz will build from the source. Can we do better? Should have a dependencies file with refenrences to
  source files using SHA1
- Fix the cairo memory leaks. Add a deallocator to our structures and call foreign-nullify in with
- Using the current directory for Jazz is clearly a temporary solution as it stops users from using
  the current directory for their own stuff
- Basic Jazz l&f

R4RS
- r4rstest.scm
- f1.0 notation
- internal defines
- quasiquote for vectors
- =>
- semantics of declarations that are bound only after beeing defined vs jazz which binds declarations
  accross the whole module. another incompatibility that is related is that scheme code can define the
  same variable multiple times -> a possible solution would be to implement scheme semantics for define
  and jazz semantics for definition which seems very consistant with both names
