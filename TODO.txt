- test the new configuration on the mac!
- pour le mac separer le gui (windows + cairo) de jazz dans (lj) (ball) ...
- put the fonts not in the bin dir

GUILLAUME
- still have the damn problem of our changes not in the Gambit distrib
- distribute jazz with a jazz.exe = gsc.exe in the architecture subdirs and put the gambit headers i use
  somewhere in the jazz source tree
- why reimplement queues in Jazz???
- should do a cleanup in the .autoload files
- need to fix the save of text is buggy and loses the last line because of the new load-lines
- optimize hashtable-merge without inter-module calls
- clean my shit in hashtables and maps
- at what point i should start looking at the generated c code for my typical code
- maybe a good approach would be to have the template macro auto turn
  (template (f T)
    (yo a T b T))
  into
  (template-macro (f T)
    `(yo a ,T b ,T))
  !!!?!!!
- the key for redraw-view-only seems that all redraw should be done in < 5ms for Windows to have the
  time to cope with the bitbliting
- PAINTBALL 17 novembre
- ummm with a restriction type we could have a type like fxstring that is a string that guaranties that
  its length is bounded in the range of fixnums!
- because I want to do all type casting at call site for natives, I will need to always call the lowlevel
  ## version of the procedure
- ummm I think that saying car's signature is <pair:object> is wrong. Really, car's signature is <object:object>
  and throws an error if its parameter is not a pair. The <pair:object> is really a compile time specializer!
- s&r complet de dc par surface
- remettre Rect a fx et faire une autre classe pour les number ou l'inverse
- start optimizing the drawing algorithm starting with the redraw-view call inside redraw-view-only

TEXT
- if I drag the selection on only one line. shouldn't I see only that one line beeing updated!?
- why oh why do I pass a clip-rect to scroll-view?
- pretty clear the problem is that invaling the scrollbar, also redraws the text somehow
- after, do not forget to also clean stable
- Jeremie: put rect-intersects-region? at the right place

DOC
- Type casting is done :
  - For native, inline and specialize at call site
  - For definitions, methods, ... and definition site
