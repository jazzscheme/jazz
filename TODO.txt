- Is ((x11 unix) at line 725 correct or just (unix) ?
- We have to think about and go through the code for what happens if we make for unix but no windowing
- Clean that i had to put
     (define cairo-include-path (path-expand "../../foreign/cairo/include"))
     (define cairo-lib-path     (path-expand "../../foreign/cairo/lib/windows"))
  at 3 diff places for windows
- Fix build on Cygwin / Windows that fails i think because Cygwin doesn't like just "jazz" just like unix
- Because of things like the text (for instance select all on a scrolled text), i do not see any other way
  than to restrict rectangles before the invalidate-rect to the platform. Do we also have to restrict so that
  if does not go further than the size of the window?
