JEREMIE
- test the new configuration on the mac!
- pour le mac separer le gui (windows + cairo) de jazz dans (lj) (ball) ...
- i moved the fonts dir inside the lib dir need to fix references
- put rect-intersects-region? at the right place
- how should we set up the new stable / dev ?

GUILLAUME
- still have the damn problem of our changes not in the Gambit distrib
- distribute jazz with a gsc.exe in the architecture subdirs!?
- ummm with a restriction type we could have a type like fxstring that is a string that guaranties that
  its length is bounded in the range of fixnums!
- s&r complet de dc par surface
- remettre Rect a fx et faire une autre classe pour les number ou l'inverse
- when axis are working, simplify the code and make sure it is well optimized for the case of rows with not alot
  of sons
- i should be able to clean *alot* of not directly related code that i was forced to put inside classes because i
  didn't have generics. A class that needs big time cleanup like this is Component
- NEED to really think about the sharing of declarations when we do stuff like reload a file

OPTIMIZE
- why are WinUser, ... appearing as .jazz in statprof??
- optimize the interpreted caching would seem to be very critical
  - ahhh not really... why does it get always called is the right question!
  - look with marc at how can jazz.cache-dispatch-interpreted appear in the statprof report
    when it is even called! is it because of how we set! the dispatcher that gambit gets mixed up?

STATPROF
- should not index the buckets on file/line/col but rather on the continuation-code object itself
  so that 2 expressions on the same line are treated separately
- should keep the stack of callers so that in the report I can show that the 16% is divided between
  those 3 call branches
- the key is what gambit object represent static code and are stable?
