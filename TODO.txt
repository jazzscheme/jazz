- still have the damn problem of our changes not in the Gambit distrib
- distribute jazz with a gsc.exe in the architecture subdirs!?
- why reimplement queues in Jazz???
- need to fix the save of text is buggy and loses the last line because of the new load-lines
- clean my shit in hashtables and maps
- at what point i should start looking at the generated c code for my typical code
- maybe a good approach would be to have the template macro auto turn
  (template (f T)
    (yo a T b T))
  into
  (template-macro (f T)
    `(yo a ,T b ,T))
  !!!?!!!
- ummm with a restriction type we could have a type like fxstring that is a string that guaranties that
  its length is bounded in the range of fixnums!
- because I want to do all type casting at call site for natives, I will need to always call the lowlevel
  ## version of the procedure
- ummm I think that saying car's signature is <pair:object> is wrong. Really, car's signature is <object:object>
  and throws an error if its parameter is not a pair. The <pair:object> is really a compile time specializer!
- s&r complet de dc par surface
- remettre Rect a fx et faire une autre classe pour les number ou l'inverse
- when there is a Primitive class, I can define it's initialize to error!
- if i do a search in gambit's c files i will find a place that marc thought of for pasting and cutting from the
  system stack
- when axis are working, simplify the code and make sure it is well optimized for the case of rows with not alot
