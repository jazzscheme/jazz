- test the new configuration on the mac!
- pour le mac separer le gui (windows + cairo) de jazz dans (lj) (ball) ...

GUILLAUME
- still have the damn problem of our changes not in the Gambit distrib
- distribute jazz with a jazz.exe = gsc.exe in the architecture subdirs and put the gambit headers i use
  somewhere in the jazz source tree
- probably scrap my layer over ports
