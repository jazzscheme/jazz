OBJECTIVES
- arguments passed to and from c functions should always be able to validate their type
- validate error return codes in debug level
- need to be able to find memory leaks of non released memory
- the cffi needs the expressivity to keep hand written c code to a strict minimum
- should enable the com interface to be build on top of it
- should enable a swig interface to c and c++ code
- support for union
- access to Gambit native types should be provided
- no warnings should be generated as much as possible


typedef
scalar
structure
union
array
pointer
function pointer


SYNTAX
- c-include
- c-declare
- c-initialize
- c-type
- c-structure
- c-external
- c-function
- c-definition


NOTES
- verify that there is no place where our code allocates a Gambit struct or union that could then
  be released by the gc and cause a crash
- add support for c-initialize!?
