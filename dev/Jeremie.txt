- Shouldn't Cairo-Win32-Surface inherit from Cairo-Surface?
- See http://cairographics.org/cookbook/win32quickstart/ for an example of using Cairo in

- I read somewhere that show_text cached the glyphs... Aren't we redoing the job then?
- Implement Clipboard which is not trivial
- Find a solution to put the dll somewhere else than the root
