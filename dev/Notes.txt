Gambit
======

- About the only thing I know where Gambit doesn't respect the same semantics between
  interpreted and compiled code (and that can lead to difficult bugs) is :
  - doing an inter-module set! on a variable that was defined in a (block) declared
    module and that wasn't modified by any set! in that module
  - the interpreted code will change the value wheras the compiled code will leave the
    value as is
