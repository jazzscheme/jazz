repl-context
  cont ;; ,d ;; the continuation to exit to the previous repl
  initial-cont ;; ,c ;; the continuation to continue

##repl will capture a continuation as the initial-cont
##repl-within can be passed an explicit initial-cont (that is what the error system will do)

the current repl is a special parameter and so the special form
(macro-dynamic-bind repl-context
  context
  thunk)
has to be used to bind it instead of parameterize
