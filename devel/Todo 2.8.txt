JEDI

Intuitive Gambit / Jazz projects
  - Fix focused project and evaluation
  - Fix Empty projects not having the name we give them in New Project
  - Un process evaluate always doit avoir l'icone seulement s'il est focuse!
Fully test Jedi


JEDI BINARIES

- Binary repo
  - One for each release
    - Small as it only contains binaries of its release
    - Points to the source using a submodule or just a naming scheme
      pointing to branches or tags in the source repo!?
  - With .o, .c, .dgs, ... in .gitignore maybe we dont need an install
- copy templates, idealy in a lib folder...
- chante templates-directory
- only profiles when source-access
  - ok to have profile in template as one could later git submodule update jazz
    - check that git submodule update jazz can be done on a binary jedi
      - with jedi source as a submodule of jedi-binary!?
- fix readme
- fix workspace formatted
