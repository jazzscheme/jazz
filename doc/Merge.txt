By creating from a patch the 3 folders: base, left and right we have the following advantages
- tools can detect unambiguously new deleted and modified files
- in the absence of a 3-way merge, tools can do 2 side by side 2-way merges
- by recreating the patched file as it was on the patch creator's version with can use more
  sophisticated algorithms like sexpr based ones
- completed merge can be discarted easily in case of problems as the actual replacing is only
  done at the end
