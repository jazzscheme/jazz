# These are the installation instructions for Termite

#1 Install the latest Gambit-C

#2 Get Termite and untar it in Gambit's lib/ directory

cd /usr/lobal/Gambit-C/current/lib

wget http://toute.ca/termite.tar.gz
tar -xzvf termite.tar.gz

# Optional:
# Manually copy the "tsi" file from Termite's directory to 
# Gambit's "bin" directory
# That's for convenience so you can start a console that acts 
# like gsi but has Termite already loaded

# All done!
