;;
;; A search automata is made up of:
;;
;;   start state:   the automata is looking for a word beginning
;;   skip state:    the automata is skipping to the end of the current word
;;   letter states: these states make up the decomposed tree of searched words
;;   found states:  these states collect found strings without advancing the tape
;;
;; Note: No effort was made to generalize this code into a reusable automata class
;;       as this clearly requires usage of templates. I will rather wait for the fully
;;       optimized and typed Jazz compiler and make this automata class in Jazz!
;;
;; Todo: Implemented Listed and Lettered transitions.
;;       Find a clean solution to a whole word that ends the file (i.e. the non-constituent
;;       transition to the found state doesn't get called!).
