; These classes are a first approximation at generalizing all the nice features
; of the Descendants-Tree that are only available for component hierarchies

; Entity                ;; every object in the tree must implement this interface
; Entity-Factory        ;; this factory class is necessary because interface relations are not propagated to the metaclass
; Entities-Controller   ;; all actions on entities will go trough this controller
; Entities-Tree
; Entity-Menu

; SLC - Unify all this with the component based framework
;       - Designer extends Entities-Controller
;       - Component-Factory extends Entity-Factory and delegates to a class slot that contains the class of the component
;       - Faut faire gaffe:
;         - Dans le Entities-Tree j'ai due permettre le clic dans le vide et le menu-add doit pouvoir deleguer
;           au parent de l'entite pour pouvoir faire un add meme si on est sur un schema...
