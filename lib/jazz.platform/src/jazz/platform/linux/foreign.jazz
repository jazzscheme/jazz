;;You can use sysconf() on both Linux and Unix systems. I doubt it will work under an M$ OS.
;;
;;The API is sysconf(name), where the 'name' I believe you would need are _SC_PHYS_PAGES to get the number of pages of physical memory, and then _SC_AVPHYS_PAGES to get the number of pages of physical memory currently available.
;;
;;Then a ratio of available memory can be computed...
;;Code:
;;double percentAvail = double(totalPages - freePages) / double(totalPages) * 100.0;
;;For Linux, you can also read/parse /proc/meminfo, but sysconf() seems a bit easier. Merely my opinion.
