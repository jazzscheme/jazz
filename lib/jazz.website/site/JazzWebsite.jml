The benchmark I have been using is editing Window.jazz a big file with lots of syntax coloring necessitating a lot of sexpr navigation. As every Lisp related tool must be able to navigate sexpr in text, those operations are so critical that in the old Jazz they where handcoded directly in C. So keep in mind that in the benchmark results, it is handcoded C code vs Jazz code generating Gambit code."
