      <h3>Vision</h3>
JazzScheme was born on December 9th, 1996 out of some profound convictions:      <ul>
        <li><span>Lisp is one of the greatest tools to experiment with new concepts and implement them.</span></li>
        <li><span>There is not a single truth in computer science and Lisp's meta-language capabilities and dynamic nature makes it the ideal language to unify in a coherent approach many great paradigms like:</span></li>
        <ul>
          <li><span>Functional Programming</span></li>
          <li><span>Object-Oriented and Generic Programming</span></li>
          <li><span>Component based Programming</span></li>
        </ul>
        <li><span>The Lisp community should not be dreaming of sophisticated GUIs and IDEs but instead be the one pushing the boundaries of what can be accomplished!</span></li>
      </ul>
      <cite>&#8216;&#8216;A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.&#8217;&#8217; -- Alan J. Perlis</cite>

      <a name="mission"></a>
      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><span>Promote the use of Lisp based languages</span></li>
        <ul>
          <li><span>Not by trying to convince people of their advantages</span></li>
          <li><span>But by enabling people to create and commercialize radical products that would have been almost impossible to develop using mainstream languages (time, cost, feasibility, ...)</span></li>
        </ul>
        <li><span>In the long run, enable more Lisp/Scheme programmers to develop at work in the language they love :)</span></li>
        <li><span>Bring back joy to programming!</span></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Operating Systems</h3>
As Jazz's main focus has always been the actual delivery of commercial, highly sophisticated GUI applications, Windows has been our primary focus and at the moment, Jazz only runs under Windows. A project named Fusion, to rewrite the Jazz Kernel from C++ to Scheme (we are trying for portable pure Scheme and have the wonderfull      <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~gambit/">Gambit</a>
Scheme system as our primary target) is currently well under way. When completed, it will enable the Jazz language to run on most operating systems.       <p></p>
For the multi-platform GUI, we have started the port using      <a href="http://cairographics.org/">Cairo</a>
. Note that the Jazz Windows GUI is already very abstract and relies little on Windows services. This should make the port if not easy, fairly manageable. We expect to have some beta releases for X11 and Macintosh ready in a couple months.     </div>
