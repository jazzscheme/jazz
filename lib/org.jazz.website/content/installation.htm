      <h3>Dependencies</h3>
      <span>
        <p></p>
        <b>Gambit</b>
        <p></p>
You need to install the latest version of Gambit. You will also need to pull all the latest changes from the Gambit repository as Marc Feely, Gambit's author, is often fixing bugs and adding new features to support the JazzScheme development. Be sure you have made a 'make bootstrap' for Gambit before pulling. This is documented on Gambit's website but is a costly gotcha as it will force you to reinstall if you forget to do it. See Gambit's INSTALL.txt file for details on installing Gambit and see Gambit's website for details on accessing Gambit's public repository: http://dynamo.iro.umontreal.ca/~gambit/wiki/index.php/Source_code_repository        <p></p>
Note that JazzScheme relies on very few Gambit specific features and was designed with ease of porting to other Scheme systems in mind.         <p></p>
All compilation is done through the underlying Scheme. As Gambit uses GCC for backend, please refer to Gambit's documentation if you're experiencing GCC problems.       </span>

        <p></p>
        <b>Cairo</b>
        <p></p>
If you plan on doing GUI development, you will need to install Cairo http://cairographics.org/. On Windows we precompiled it for you as a dll. On other systems, you should install it the usual way (with your package manager) and Jazz will use pkg-config to find the various paths. If you are on Mac, you must install macports from http://www.macports.org/. If you decide to compile your own versions of the libraries, pkg-config will need to know where they are installed. You should set the environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH to the appropriate directories.       </span>
      <span>
        <p></p>
        <b>X11 on the Mac</b>
        <p></p>
Due to a bug in Apple's installed version of X11, if you plan on using X11 on the Mac, you will need to install the latest X11 version from http://xquartz.macosforge.org/. Note that this is the official apple site for X11 on the Mac.       </span>
