;; I think that obtaining complete genericity for this framework
;; of transformation and rendering in a completly object-oriented fashion
;; will require the Jazz OO to be 100% Lisp based. The key to building the OO
;; in Lisp will be to really think it completly in functional terms and then only
;; after add the syntax layer on top. The syntax layer should expand to very simple
;; calls that are completly usable at run time by themselves. One thing for this is
;; to really clarify what is the concept of code.
